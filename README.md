Description:

This is a simple Train Scheduler web application designed to allow train station employees to add in trains coming to the station as they receive information. The employees can enter the train name, destination, frequency (in minutes), next arrival, and how many minutes the train is away. The information is kept in a Firebase database in order to maintain the information with each reload. The application uses moment.js to format and calculate the times. 

This application can be run on a browser on the user’s computer or on a phone/tablet.
