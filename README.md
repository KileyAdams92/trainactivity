Train Scheduler
This is a simple Train Scheduler web application designed to allow train station employees to add in trains coming to the station as they receive information. The employees can enter the train name, destination, frequency (in minutes), next arrival, and how many minutes the train is away. The information is kept in a Firebase database in order to maintain the information with each reload. The application uses moment.js to format and calculate the times. 


Motivation
During the course of studying web development through the University of Kansas, I learned the importance of utilizing new libraries and technologies. Using Firebase as a database was the first initial step into backend development. During this project I also learned more about how computers format time and the importance of using a library similar to Moment.js.
